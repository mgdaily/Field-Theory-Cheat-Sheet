# Field-Theory-Cheat-Sheet
[LaTeX] Cheat Sheet Made for ECE 134 at UCSB

Thanks to StackOverflow user Dror for the template for this sheet. http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/8915

This was my first real attempt at making anything useful in LaTeX. My ECE 134 professor allowed us two sides of notes for the final,
and this proved to be the best way to save space and keep some semblance of organization.

This sheet was made over the course of about 6 weeks, and proved to be a crash course in LaTeX math type and formatting. 
It took some time, but I am extremely pleased at how gorgeous LaTeX documents make things look. Feel free to use for your own
reference! I take no responsibility for any errors (I got an A in the class, if that helps bolster your confidence ;])
